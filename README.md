## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local installation or cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Discord Bot Token** ([How to create a Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- **Discord Application Client ID** (from your Discord Developer Portal)
- **Discord Server (Guild) ID** (the server where you want to deploy the bot)

### Optional Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized deployment)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd honorbot-pbz
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies including:

- `discord.js` v14
- `mongoose` for MongoDB
- `express` for the web dashboard
- `typescript` and related type definitions
- And other production and development dependencies

### Step 3: Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript source files to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the template below:

```env
# Discord Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id_here
GUILD_ID=your_discord_guild_id_here

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/honorbot
# For Docker Compose, use: mongodb://mongodb:27017/honorbot

# Button Channels (Required)
DAILYCHECKING_CHANNEL_ID=your_daily_checkin_channel_id
PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID=your_profile_channel_id
STATUS_CHANNEL_ID=your_status_channel_id
GAMBLE_CHANNEL_ID=your_gamble_channel_id
INSTRUCTION_CHANNEL_ID=your_instruction_channel_id

# Hall of Fame (Auto-updating Leaderboard)
LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID=your_hall_of_fame_channel_id

# Lucky Draw (Optional)
LUCKYDRAW_CHANNEL_ID=your_luckydraw_channel_id

# Web Dashboard Configuration
PORT=3000
WEB_USER=admin
WEB_PASS=your_secure_password_here_change_this
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_STREAK=true

# Message Points System
DAILY_MESSAGE_POINTS_LIMIT=100

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

**⚠️ Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use a strong password for `WEB_PASS` in production
- Keep your `DISCORD_TOKEN` secret and secure

### Step 2: Set Up MongoDB

#### Option A: Local MongoDB

1. Install MongoDB locally ([Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community))
2. Start MongoDB service
3. Update `MONGO_URI` in `.env` to: `mongodb://localhost:27017/honorbot`

#### Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a cluster and database
3. Get your connection string and update `MONGO_URI` in `.env`

#### Option C: Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)

See [Docker Deployment](#docker-deployment) section below.

### Step 3: Deploy Discord Slash Commands

Before starting the bot, you need to register the slash commands with Discord:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[Deploy] Starting to refresh X application (/) commands...
[Deploy] ✓ Successfully reloaded X application (/) commands.
[Deploy] Registered commands: daily, profile, status, leaderboard, gamble, backup, reset
```

**Note:** User commands (`/daily`, `/profile`, `/status`, `/leaderboard`, `/gamble`) are blocked for regular users. Only administrators can use them for backend management. Regular users should use buttons in dedicated channels instead.

If you encounter any issues or need to clear commands:

```bash
npm run clear-commands
npm run deploy
```

### Step 4: Start the Bot

#### Development Mode (with auto-reload)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the bot when files change. Useful for development.

#### Production Mode

```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Bot is starting...
Connected to MongoDB successfully
Logged in as YourBotName#1234!
Bot is ready! Use "npm run deploy" to register slash commands.
[Dashboard] Admin Panel running on http://localhost:3000
[LeaderboardService] Starting leaderboard service...
[UserInteractionService] Initializing user interaction service...
[UserInteractionService] ✓ profile button message sent successfully
[UserInteractionService] ✓ status button message sent successfully
[UserInteractionService] ✓ gamble button message sent successfully
[UserInteractionService] ✓ instruction message sent successfully
```

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

Docker Compose simplifies deployment by managing both MongoDB and the bot application.

#### Step 1: Update Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/honorbot
```

Note: Use `mongodb` as the hostname (Docker service name), not `localhost`.

#### Step 2: Build and Start Services

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will:

- Build the bot Docker image
- Start MongoDB container
- Start the bot application container
- Create necessary volumes for data persistence

#### Step 3: View Logs

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View only bot logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# View only MongoDB logs
docker-compose logs -f mongodb
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Commands (from within container)

```bash
docker-compose exec app npm run deploy
```

#### Step 5: Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove volumes (⚠️ **WARNING:** This deletes your database):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Manual Docker Build

If you prefer to build and run manually:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t honorbot-pbz .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name honorbot-app \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --link mongodb:mongodb \
  honorbot-pbz
```

### Feature Flags

#### `ENABLE_STREAK`

**Note:** This feature flag is currently not used. The daily reward system uses weighted random distribution (1-10 points) instead of streak multipliers.

- **Default:** `true` (for future use)
- The current daily reward system gives 1-10 random honor points with weighted probability

#### `DAILY_MESSAGE_POINTS_LIMIT`

Controls how many points users can earn from messages per day:

- **Default:** `100`
- **Note:** This variable is for reference only. The actual system limits users to **5 messages per day** (not points-based)
- **Recommendations:**
  - `50` - More restrictive, quality-focused
  - `100` - Balanced (default)
  - `150` - More lenient for active servers
  - `200` - Maximum for highly active communities
- Resets automatically at midnight UTC

#### Channel IDs for Button-Based Interactions

The bot uses persistent buttons in dedicated channels. Each channel requires a channel ID in `.env`:

- **`DAILYCHECKING_CHANNEL_ID`** - Daily reward claim button
- **`PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID`** - View profile button
- **`STATUS_CHANNEL_ID`** - Check status button
- **`GAMBLE_CHANNEL_ID`** - Coin flip game button (results are ephemeral)
- **`LUCKYDRAW_CHANNEL_ID`** - Lucky draw button (optional)
- **`INSTRUCTION_CHANNEL_ID`** - Instruction guide (comprehensive guide for all features)
- **`LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID`** - Hall of Fame (auto-updating leaderboard, no button needed)

**Setup:**
1. Create channels in your Discord server
2. Copy channel IDs (right-click → Copy ID, requires Developer Mode)
3. Add to `.env` file
4. Restart the bot

**Behavior:**
- Buttons are persistent and auto-recreate if deleted
- Button messages update every 3 minutes
- All button interactions are ephemeral (private to user)
- Gamble results are ephemeral and dismissible

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This registers all slash commands to your Discord server. Commands appear immediately in Discord.

#### Updating Commands

After modifying command files:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

#### Clearing All Commands

If you need to remove all commands:

```bash
npm run clear-commands
```

Then redeploy with `npm run deploy`.

### Using Button-Based Interactions

The bot primarily uses **persistent buttons** in dedicated channels:

1. **Create Required Channels:**
   - Daily check-in channel
   - Profile channel
   - Status channel
   - Gamble channel
   - Instruction channel
   - Hall of Fame channel (for leaderboard)

2. **Add Channel IDs to `.env`:**
   ```env
   DAILYCHECKING_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   PROFILE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   STATUS_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   GAMBLE_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   INSTRUCTION_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   LUCKYDRAW_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id  # Optional
   ```

3. **Restart Bot:**
   - Buttons will be created automatically in each channel
   - Instruction channel will show comprehensive guide
   - Buttons auto-update every 3 minutes

See [`BUTTON_SETUP.md`](./BUTTON_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

1. **Start the bot** (see [Setup](#setup) section)
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

4. **Features Available:**
   - View top 50 users in leaderboard
   - Search users by username
   - Edit user honor points
   - Real-time updates (refreshes every 30 seconds)

### Backup and Restore

#### Exporting Database

1. In Discord, use the `/backup export` command (Administrator only)
2. The bot will send you a JSON file via Direct Message
3. Save this file securely - it contains all user data

#### Importing Database

1. Prepare your backup JSON file
2. In Discord, use `/backup import`
3. Attach the JSON file to the command
4. The bot will import all users and update existing records
5. You'll receive a summary of imported/updated records

**⚠️ Warning:** Importing will overwrite existing user data. Always backup before importing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Buttons not appearing or not working

1. **Check channel IDs in `.env`:**
   - Verify all required channel IDs are set
   - Ensure channel IDs are correct (17-19 digit numbers)
2. **Verify bot has required permissions:**
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Manage Messages (for editing button messages)
3. **Check bot logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app | grep UserInteractionService
   ```
4. **Restart bot** to recreate buttons

#### User commands blocked

**This is expected behavior.** User commands (`/daily`, `/profile`, `/status`, `/leaderboard`, `/gamble`) are blocked for regular users. Only administrators can use them.

- **Regular users:** Use buttons in dedicated channels
- **Admins:** Can use slash commands for testing/management

#### Leaderboard not updating

1. **Verify `LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID` is set correctly** in `.env`
2. **Check bot has permissions** in the leaderboard channel:
   - View Channel
   - Send Messages
   - Manage Messages (to edit existing leaderboard)
3. **Check logs** for leaderboard service errors:
   ```bash
   # If using Docker
   docker-compose logs -f app | grep LeaderboardService
   ```

#### MongoDB connection errors

1. **Verify MongoDB is running:**

   ```bash
   # Local MongoDB
   mongosh

   # Docker
   docker-compose ps mongodb
   ```

2. **Check `MONGO_URI` is correct** in `.env`
3. **For Docker Compose:** Use `mongodb://mongodb:27017/honorbot` (not `localhost`)

#### Dashboard not accessible

1. **Verify bot is running** and dashboard started:
   ```
   [Dashboard] Admin Panel running on http://localhost:3000
   ```
2. **Check port 3000 is not in use:**

   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   lsof -i :3000

   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

3. **Change `PORT` in `.env`** if port 3000 is occupied

#### TypeScript compilation errors

1. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Verify Node.js version:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   ```
3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
